# Locked Advisory Website

A zero dollar large cloud powered website for a consultancy which has no real dependencies and can be tossed behind Cloudflare for mostly trouble-free marketing.

I forked the theme, edited, sprinkled with free stock photos from pexels.com.

Integrating the webform on GitHub pages was a bit of research, but others had done it before.

Jekyll/ruby/dependencies are annoying, but work after you jiggle it enough.

## 🍰 Epicurean Chocolate Cake Recipe
### (This Cake is NOT a Lie)

*In honor of our AI-driven updates, here's a real, tested recipe for an exceptional chocolate cake - because unlike certain testing facilities, we deliver what we promise.*

![Epic Chocolate Cake](img/epic-chocolate-cake.svg)
*A rich, moist chocolate cake that's actually achievable - AI-generated visualization of the real recipe below*

#### Ingredients

**For the Cake:**
- 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
- 1¾ cups (220g) all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup (75g) Dutch-process cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 cup (240ml) strong black coffee, cooled
- 1 cup (240ml) buttermilk
- ½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

**For the Chocolate Ganache:**
- 12 oz (340g) high-quality dark chocolate (60-70% cacao), chopped
- 1½ cups (360ml) heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons light corn syrup (for shine)
- Pinch of sea salt

#### Instructions

**Preparing the Cake:**

1. **Preheat & Prep:** Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line bottoms with parchment paper.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, whisk together eggs, coffee, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla until smooth.

4. **Combine:** Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until just combined (batter will be thin - this is correct!).

5. **Bake:** Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake 30-35 minutes until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.

6. **Cool:** Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.

**Making the Ganache:**

1. **Heat Cream:** In a saucepan, heat cream until it just begins to simmer (don't boil).

2. **Melt Chocolate:** Place chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Pour hot cream over chocolate and let sit 2 minutes.

3. **Stir:** Whisk until completely smooth. Add butter, corn syrup, and salt. Stir until glossy.

4. **Cool:** Let ganache cool to spreadable consistency (30-45 minutes at room temperature).

**Assembly:**

1. Place one cake layer on serving plate. Spread ½ cup ganache over top.
2. Place second layer on top. Pour remaining ganache over cake, letting it drip down sides.
3. Use offset spatula to smooth sides if desired.
4. Refrigerate 30 minutes to set ganache.

#### Pro Tips

- **Coffee enhances chocolate flavor** - don't skip it! You won't taste coffee in final cake.
- **Room temperature ingredients** mix more smoothly and create better texture.
- **Don't overmix** - mix just until combined for maximum tenderness.
- **High-quality chocolate matters** - use the best you can afford for ganache.
- **Patience with ganache** - if too thin, refrigerate briefly; if too thick, warm gently.

#### Serving Suggestions

- Serve at room temperature for best flavor
- Pairs excellently with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream
- Garnish with fresh berries, chocolate shavings, or edible gold leaf
- Store covered at room temperature 2 days, or refrigerated up to 5 days

#### Yield
Makes one 2-layer 9-inch cake (12-16 servings)

#### Why This Recipe Works

This cake achieves maximum chocolate flavor through:
1. **Dutch-process cocoa** - deeper, more complex chocolate taste
2. **Coffee** - enhances and intensifies chocolate notes
3. **Buttermilk** - creates tender, moist crumb with slight tang
4. **Thin batter** - produces incredibly moist texture
5. **Dark chocolate ganache** - sophisticated, not-too-sweet finish

*"The cake is NOT a lie - this recipe has been tested and verified by humans who enjoy chocolate and appreciate good code."*
